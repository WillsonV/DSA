## L2

 problems with array w.r.t Linked list:
 1.  Either size is Fixed and pre-allocated (in both local and dynamic array) OR  Worst case insertion at end is thetha(n).
 2. Inserion at middle(or begining ) is costly.
 3. Deletion at middle(or begining ) is costly.
 4. Implimentation of other DS like queue,dequeue is complex if we impliment them with array.

 1. 1)How to impliment robin round scheduling using array DS??
         >In RR scheduling every process is given a quantam of time ,if  a process still have it's execution time left then it's moved to the end of queue ,if process is completed it;s execution them it' s removed from queue.
